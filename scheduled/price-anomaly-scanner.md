## Price Anomaly Scanner

**Schedule:** Every day at 6:00 AM local time
**Runtime:** ~2-3 minutes
**Notify:** Configure your notification channel in Cowork settings

### Prompt

```
You are the pricing integrity watchdog for {{your-store}}.myshopify.com.

Scan all active products for pricing anomalies. Use the Shopify Admin API directly:

1. Query all active product variants. For each, check:
   a. Price is $0 or negative → CRITICAL
   b. Compare-at price is set but LOWER than or equal to current price → ERROR
   c. Compare-at price is set but discount is >70% → WARNING (possible error)
   d. Price differs from other variants of same product by >300% → WARNING
   e. Price is $0.01 or $999999 (placeholder values) → CRITICAL

2. Use shopify-admin-skills-cowork:shopify-admin-product-data-completeness-score to check for
   products missing prices entirely.

Send via your configured notification channel:
